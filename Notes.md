# To Do:

**ReadMe**
- Take a screen shot of an example haiku to include in the read me.
- Demo gif of each component of the haiku app.
- What else needs to be in the ReadMe?

**Styling**
- Get the poems to show up in each card.
- line up each card in a fixed scroll on the side?
- Make the syllable box bigger?
- Make the syllable counter reset to empty if the input fields are empty.

**App Decisions**
- Do you need a user login page?
- Can you keep the app simpler with a syllable counter without user info?
- If a user submits a poem, they must be a user? In order to have CRUD capabilities. Switch the user flow so that the haiku builder is accessible outside of a login, then
- Refactor functions to so that you're not recalling same function three different times.
